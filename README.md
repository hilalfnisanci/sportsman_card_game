# sportsman_card_game
A simple card game will be designed in which a player (this will be the user) can compete with the automatic player (against the computer).

A total of 16 athlete cards will be found in the game to be designed. 8 of these cards must be a football player and 8 must be a basketball player.

Each user will be randomly distributed 4 basketball players, 4 football player cards. Football players have a penalty, free kick, and goalkeeper. Basketball players have three-pointers, two-pointers, and free throws.

The user and computer will choose one of the 8 cards distributed to them in each move. Each move must be in the form of a football player in consecutive order to be played with the cards of a basketball player.
